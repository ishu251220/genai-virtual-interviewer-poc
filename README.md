# Executive Summary

The "GenAI Virtual Interviewer" is a Proof of Concept (POC) that simulates real-life mock interviews using AI. It is designed to help students, freshers, and professionals practice interviews anytime from home.

It solves the common problem of time-consuming manual interviews by introducing a smart chatbot that:
- Asks technical or HR-style questions.
- Understands resumes using PDF reading tools.
- Gives instant feedback on answers.
- Is simple to use and beginner-friendly.

The goal is to create a system that supports job readiness without the need for real interviewers in early rounds. This project uses tools like ChatGPT (LLM), LangChain (optional), PDF readers, and simple UI tools. It can be scaled later to support voice, video, and scoring.
